New Functionalities Added:

- Users can now apply additional filters for vendors by selecting the "More Filters" option. They can choose multiple vendors to display games from specific providers within a selected category. If no category is chosen, all games from the selected vendors will be shown.

- Users can mark games as "Starred" while browsing. Starred games will appear in a dedicated "Starred Games" tab and will persist across using Zustand for state management.
